Overview
--------

dms2dfe (**D**\ eep **M**\ utational **S**\ canning (DMS) data to **D**\ istribution of **F**\ itness **E**\ ffects (DFE)) is an integrative analysis workflow designed for end-to-end enrichment analysis of Deep Mutational Scaning [1]_ data. Among many experimental designs Deep Mutational Scaning asssay, this workflow, currently, is only applicable for **pairwise comparisons** of samples.
`dms2dfe` makes use of efficient libraries such as `pandas` [2]_ to handle data tables, `pysam` [3]_ to process sequence alignment files and `biopython` [4]_ to handle PDB structures.

Basic usage
-----------

:ref:`Installation`

To install the package, first `create a conda environment`_ and execute following command:

.. code-block:: text

    pip install dms2dfe

.. _create a conda environment: 1installation.html#before-install-recommended

Note: python 2.7 and linux (tested on debian) are required.

:ref:`Usage`

From bash command line, create a project directory

.. code-block:: text

    dms2dfe project_directory

Insert input parameters in the configuration files (.csv) located in `project_directory/cfg`   

Run the analysis,
